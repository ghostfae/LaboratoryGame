## Purpose
I wanted to explore state machines and user interactions in a simple manner, practicing my OOP skills in the process. The code is simple but it does what it needs to do with no error.

## Plans
Currently this project is in a finished state, but if I wanted to improve upon it I would refactor the dialogue to create a dialogue tree-like system.

## Credits
ChatGPT 4.0 for generating the room prompts
